[own docs](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/stable/doc/TUTORIAL.md#checkout-dependencies)
for more info

### Install
1. Clone repo
2. run `lein install` to install the lib locally and allow lein to
   find it (needs to be done with every version bump)
   
### Use in other projects locally
3. add a folder `checkouts` to the root of your project
4. inside `checkouts` create a symlink to the nand-clj folder:
   ```
   cd into ./checkouts
   ln -s path-to/nand-clj nand-clj
   ```
5. then start your repl
